CA Glossary


Requirements:
============
- eZ Publish 4.x

Installing:
==========
1°) Extract the extension in the eZ Publish extension folder

2°) Activate the extension in your site.ini (ActiveExtensions[]=ca_glossary) or in the extension menu of eZ back office

4°) Create a new content class for your glossary items
      There must be at least the following attributes : Title (type : text line) and Definition (type: text bloc)
      You can give whatever identifier you want as you can change it in glossary.ini

3°) Go to settings folder and edit glossary.ini
      Change the node_id of the object that contains glossary items
      Change information of content class (created on step 4)
      Check authorized tags

4°) If you are using the ezwebin mechanism to load your CSS files then ce_glossary.css will be automatically added thanks to these lines in design.ini :
        [StylesheetSettings]
        CSSFileList[]=ca_glossary.css

    Otherwise, you'll have to load the file in your pagelayout or add css rules in your own css file.

5°) Finally, the extension override template loaded when {attribute_view_gui attribute="your_xml_text"} is called.
    If you want to call the operator on a specific text you can simply call : {ca_glossary("your xml text")}

    NB : You can change the ca_glossary.tpl to adapt the text replacement of each items.
